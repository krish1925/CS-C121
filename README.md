# Computational Genomics Projects

This repository contains a series of projects that focused on various aspects of computational genomics. Each project addressed specific challenges and concepts within genomics and computational biology. Below is a detailed overview of the projects included in this repository:

## Projects:

1. **Conditional Probability Analysis (HW1)**
   - Explored the role of conditional probability in genomic sequencing and error analysis. Understood how conditional probability models were essential for accurately identifying sequencing errors and improving the reliability of genomic data. Learned more about conditional probability [here](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/1_2_2_conditional_probability.php).

2. **SNP Detection using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (HW2)**
   - Detected Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) techniques for genetic variation analysis. Implemented algorithms to identify genetic variations within DNA sequences and understood their significance in evolutionary studies. Read more about MLE [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation).

3. **Normalization Techniques for Genomic Data (HW3)**
   - Implemented normalization methods to mitigate biases and variations in experimental data. Explored techniques such as quantile normalization and variance stabilization to ensure accurate and reliable analysis of genomic datasets. Understood the importance of data normalization in reducing technical artifacts and improving downstream analysis. Learned about normalization techniques [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbv007).

4. **De Bruijn Graphs and Pseudoalignment (HW4)**
   - Constructed and utilized De Bruijn graphs for genome assembly and alignment tasks. Learned how De Bruijn graphs represented genomic sequences and facilitated efficient sequence analysis, particularly in the context of next-generation sequencing data. Implemented algorithms for pseudoalignment to rapidly map sequencing reads to reference genomes. Explored De Bruijn graphs further [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph).

5. **Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Missing Data (HW5)**
   - Applied the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to handle missing information in genomic datasets for parameter estimation. Understood the iterative nature of the EM algorithm and its applications in genomic data analysis, particularly in scenarios where data was incomplete or contained missing values. Read more about the EM algorithm [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm).

6. **Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction (HW6)**
   - Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and clustering of high-dimensional genomic datasets. Implemented PCA algorithms to identify patterns and relationships within genomic data and reduce its dimensionality while preserving its essential features. Explored the applications of PCA in genomics [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg896).

These projects offered practical experience in analyzing genomic data and applying computational techniques to address challenges in genomics research.
